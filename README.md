This project is a modular SaaS-based CRM and Client Lifecycle Management (CLM) system enhanced with AI and voice control capabilities. It is designed to demonstrate end-to-end skills in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), data engineering, predictive analytics, and API integration.

Project Overview

This CRM/CLM platform is split into five key parts:

Part 1: Intelligent Lead Scoring & CLM Prediction (Python/Scala)

✅ Supervised machine learning model to score leads based on engagement metrics

✅ Second model to predict customer churn or Next Best Action (NBA)

✅ Models trained, evaluated, and deployed via REST APIs using Flask or FastAPI



---

Part 2: Voice-Controlled CRM Commands (NLP Module)

✅ Voice-to-text conversion using Google Speech-to-Text or Whisper

✅ NLP pipeline to parse CRM commands like: “Add a new lead from ABC Corp.”

✅ Return structured JSON responses





---

Part 3: Client Lifecycle Timeline Generator

✅ Generate synthetic customer lifecycle data

✅ Visualize lifecycle stages and predictive milestones via timeline plots



---

Part 4: SaaS Multi-Tenant Schema Design + Data Privacy

✅ Proposed relational data schema for tenants, users, leads, and voice logs

✅ ER diagram and explanation of data isolation and log security in a multi-client architecture



---

Part 5: API Integration Design (Kotlin, Angular, Perl)

✅ High-level design showing how voice modules, ML models, and UI components integrate via RESTful APIs

✅ Diagrams or pseudocode included for clarity



**CONCLUSION**

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building an intelligent, AI-driven CRM and Client Lifecycle Management platform. By combining predictive analytics, machine learning, NLP, and multi-tenant SaaS architecture, it delivers practical solutions for modern customer engagement challenges. The integration of voice control, REST APIs, and data visualizations enhances both usability and insight generation.
